## it's a new start

### Why English?
because I want to learn English. 
In the past, there were a lot of interesting things that I wanted to record, but then I forgot about them, and sometimes it's still fun to go back and look at them. Writing in English is destined to be a stumbling block, but it's all determined, so I'm going to at least give it a try.
### For what?
I don't know, maybe I just want to record something.
### What's next?
Record some technical things.

### What's the name of the blog?

I call it "WuLong", Because now I have a bottle of oolong tea on hand to keep me company. I use this name picking method all the time.
